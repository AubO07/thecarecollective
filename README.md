# The Care Collective

> _“We connect & champion Britain’s 12 million unpaid carers so they can transform lives —  
>  and turn today’s hidden cost into tomorrow’s shared value.”_

---

## ✨ Vision
A society that recognises, rewards and empowers every unpaid carer.

## 🎯 Mission
Build a **secure Digital ID & support platform** that  
* connects carers to resources, employers and one another  
* unlocks contribution, wellbeing and economic participation  
* saves the Treasury billions while improving lives

## 🌍 Why Now?
* Ageing population & shrinking workforce  
* £162 bn+ annual savings already delivered by carers  
* Tech + policy gap we can close quickly
